# cellular-automata-cryptography
block cipher with class 4 cellular automata

The exchange currently goes like this:

1. Alice sends the ciphertext and the seed
2. Bob calculates the plaintext.
3. That's it. The seed is the key.

##Current Features
1. Print random pretty automata (print\_triangles.py)
2. Print larger automata (blocks.py)
3. Unfinished connection work (s\_c\_gui.py)
